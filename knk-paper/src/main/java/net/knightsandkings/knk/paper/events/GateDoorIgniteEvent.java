 * Fired when a closed, active, non-destroyed gate's door block is hit by something that should

 * Deliberately separate from GateDoorDamageEvent - igniting a block and damaging a gate are
 * distinct consequences of a hit, and a listener may want to react to one without the other (see
 * GateFireSystem, which owns the burn-duration/damage-over-time bookkeeping).
